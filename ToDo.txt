# Tasks to better OP
## working on...
protein trees
    check that CDS,prot,both options work in main function
    rename CDS specific parameters 

## big task
[] synteny aware orthology (like genespace)
[] add "best genomes" choice to ANI subsample 
[] allow users to input precomputted HMMs
[] fix all dirtbag multithreading to use number of jobs 
[] something about saturation
    entropy? Nah
    nuc fraction distance? Maybe
        Could do soemthing by clade? Nah
    Maybe get internode dist from ansestral state reconstruction vs GTR dist
    automate comparison between prot and nuc tree and look for LBA or comp bias pulling in
[] option to partition by third position (or mask out)
[] add new sequences to old analysis
    find prots for each OG
    add to alignment
    add to tree
        Scalable pplacer: https://github.com/gillichu/PLUSplacer-taxtastic
        IQtree: Can do using a guide tree. 
            If we can use all the precomputed model parameters, that would be awesome
## small task
[] move all hmm seach stuff out of annot_prots.shortlist
[] add checkpoints for smaller steps 
    trimming
    SCOs
    concatenate
    alignment assesments
[X] clean up the paralog remover
