# Tasks to better OP
## working on...
protein trees
    [X] check that CDS,PROT,BOTH options work in main function
    [X] rename CDS specific parameters 
    [X] pal2nal complains about internal prot trimming....need to fix
        [X] TRIMAL works great!!!
	[X] reorder the whole workflow!!!
        [] test reordered workflow
    [X] fix CDS concat call to run on all OG_SCO_* like prot
    [X] write functions for prot specific workflow
        [X] TRIM_PROTS
	    [X] concatenate_prots
	    [X] build_ML_trees
	    [X] build_gene_trees
	    [X] build_ASTRAL_trees
    
# Low priority
[] fix OrthoFinder only SCO ident
[X] add back in Alignments assesment

## big task
{X} switch from FastANI to MASH for for protein shortlist
    {X} FastANI is an aftraction of kmer distance to get ~ANI 
    {X} Might as well use Kmer sketch distance directly
    {} Add variable to evo distance? need more and shorter kmers for order level stuff 

[] synteny aware orthology (like genespace)
[] add "best genomes" choice to ANI subsample 
[] add root assemblies for automatic tree generation
[] allow users to input precomputted HMMs
[X] fix all dirtbag multithreading to use number of jobs 
[] something about saturation
    entropy? Nah
    nuc fraction distance? Maybe
        Could do soemthing by clade? Nah
    Maybe get internode dist from ansestral state reconstruction vs GTR dist
    automate comparison between prot and nuc tree and look for LBA or comp bias pulling in
[] option to partition by third position (or mask out)

## small task
[] move all hmm seach stuff out of annot_prots.shortlist
[] add checkpoints for smaller steps 
    trimming
    SCOs
    concatenate
    alignment assesments
[X] clean up the paralog remover

## add new sequences to old analysis
    {X} switch to MASCE for codon aware alignments 
    {X} trimal backtranslation isnt trimming aware and doesnt throw an error...
        {X} save trimmed prot columns, translate columns to nuc, then trim nuc with them
    {X }Revert to MAFFT because MACSE is so damn slow!!!
    {X} find prots for each OG
        {X} NEED TO FIX NAMES FIRST FOR PARALOG SCORE
    {X} add to OG alignments
    {X} add to tree
        Nah - Scalable pplacer: https://github.com/gillichu/PLUSplacer-taxtastic
        {X} IQtree: Can do using a guide tree. 
            {X} If we can use all the precomputed model parameters, that would be awesome
    {X} fix addasm not working with previous Orthophyl only run
