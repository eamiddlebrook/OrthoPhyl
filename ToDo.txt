# Tasks to better OP
## working on...
protein trees
    [X] check that CDS,PROT,BOTH options work in main function
    [X] rename CDS specific parameters 
    [X] pal2nal complains about internal prot trimming....need to fix
        [X] TRIMAL works great!!!
	[X] reorder the whole workflow!!!
        [] test reordered workflow
    [] fix CDS concat call to run on all OG_SCO_* like prot
    [] write functions for prot specific workflow
        [X] TRIM_PROTS
	    concatenate_prots
	    build_ML_trees
	    build_gene_trees
	    build_ASTRAL_trees
    
    # Low priority
    [] fix OrthoFinder only SCO ident
    [] add back in Alignments assesment

## big task
[] synteny aware orthology (like genespace)
[] add "best genomes" choice to ANI subsample 
[] allow users to input precomputted HMMs
[] fix all dirtbag multithreading to use number of jobs 
[] something about saturation
    entropy? Nah
    nuc fraction distance? Maybe
        Could do soemthing by clade? Nah
    Maybe get internode dist from ansestral state reconstruction vs GTR dist
    automate comparison between prot and nuc tree and look for LBA or comp bias pulling in
[] option to partition by third position (or mask out)

## small task
[] move all hmm seach stuff out of annot_prots.shortlist
[] add checkpoints for smaller steps 
    trimming
    SCOs
    concatenate
    alignment assesments
[X] clean up the paralog remover

## add new sequences to old analysis
    X find prots for each OG
        NEED TO FIX NAMES FIRST FOR PARALOG SCORE
    add to alignment
    add to tree
        Scalable pplacer: https://github.com/gillichu/PLUSplacer-taxtastic
        IQtree: Can do using a guide tree. 
            If we can use all the precomputed model parameters, that would be awesome
